## Preface
It's been a very long time since I've done a *fresh install* on this unit, as I hackintoshed it with when first getting this unit 6 or 7 years ago with **Mavericks**, and have only done upgrades since then, so this is more for my own notes than an actual installation guide, and currently is in relation to supporting **macOS Big Sur**.

## Hardware Specs
- Intel Core i7-4710HQ [Haswell] Processor 2.5 GHz (Turbo up to 3.5 GHz)
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M (4GB GDDR5, GM107) Optimus w/Intel HD4600
- Mediatek MT7630E (Ralink) WiFi -> Replaced with [BCM94352HMB](https://www.newegg.ca/broadcom-bcm94352hmb-m-2-mini-pci-e/p/0XM-00BD-00005)
- Realktek HD Audio ALC668
- Realtek RTS5208 PCI Card Reader
- Asus SmartTouch (Synaptics) PS2 Touchpad

## Quick Installation Notes

 - Use one of the [guides](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-create-a-macos-big-sur-public-beta-installation-usb.300100/) available on the internet to create USB installer for Big Sur and complete installation. 
 - Note that I preferred to use **Clover** *(v5123 or greater)*, as OpenCore seems to have an issue with rebooting on this machine *(shutdown/sleep are fine, but restart fails on a blank screen)*; There are notes below about configuring OpenCore for reference.
 - I have also installed macOS to an internal NVMe drive and am booting from the Windows EFI partition  (because the bios lacks NVMe boot support) and originally thought OpenCore was failing to detect macOS due to this, but further testing found that this was due to originally upgrading Big Sur via the main installation partition instead of the preboot partition (see below), which was another reason I chose to stick with Clover.
 - You can [build a custom BIOS](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?110850-G771JM-Custom-BIOS-with-NVMe-Support) to enable support for booting directly from the NVMe controller/drive instead, but I was getting random BSOD in Windows and reverted back to this more stable method.
 - You need to enable some DSDT patches in Clover to support Catalina or greater, specifically the `EC0 to EC` patch *(see more detailed installation notes below)* but essentially can use the same `config.plist` for Clover on your installation USB if installed for the same `Asus G771JM` model.
 - **Improtant:** Ensure you select the `Preboot` partition after the second reboot during installation to avoid issues with AppStore downloads failing post-upgrade. (read more [here](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/issues/300#issuecomment-731096921) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/jtv7cn/clover_big_sur_app_store_download_stuck_on/)) 
	 - Edit the Clover `config.plist` file *(if using the one provided here)* and comment out or remove the line that hides this `Preboot` partition prior to installing Big Sur!
	 - [Signing of Apple ID and clearing cache](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/issues/300#issuecomment-729718708), as well as booting once from preboot with [SIP enabled](https://hackintosher.com/forums/thread/enable-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-on-a-hackintosh.53/) seemed to finally make it work again.
	 - Because of this issue, moving to OpenCore might be preferable, but this system seems to have an issue with restart not working *(still investigating)*

## Detailed Installation and Configuration Notes
**BIOS RELATED:**

Ensure BIOS has Display Memory set to 64MB and that both Secure Boot and CSM mode is disabled.   If VT-d left enabled, ensure to enable `DsiableIoMapper` quirk in Clover.

**CLOVER RELATED:**

 - **ACPI/DSDT/Patches**  include: `change _OSI to XOSI`, `change _DSM to XDSM`, `change EC0 to EC`, `change GFX0 to IGPU`, `change SAT0 to SATA`, `change EHC1 to EH01`, `change EHC2 to EH02`, and `change B0D3 to HDAU`
 
  - **ACPI/SSDT/Generate/PluginType** is enabled (true) to take advantage of CPU scaling SSDT generated by **[ssdtPRGen](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh)**.

 - SMBIOS Definition set for **MacBookPro11,2** which closely matches the hardware of the Asus G771JM

 - Enable the following Quicks in Clover v5123 or greater to enable proper OpenRuntime.efi support:
	 - AvoidRuntimeDefrag
	 - EnableSafeModeSlide
	 - EnableWriteUnprotector
	 - ProvideCustomSlide
	 - SetupVitrualMap
	 - DsiableIoMapper *(if VT-d enabled in BIOS)* 
	 - XhciPortLimit

- `Devices` has  `IntelGFX` set to `0x04128086`, `Audio` -> `Inject`set to 3, `SetIntelBacklight` and `SetIntelMaxBacklight` enabled.
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1B,0x0)` is defined with the following properties: 
		- key: `No-hda-gfx` value: `00000000 00000000 00` type: `DATA`
		-  key: `alc-layout-id` value: `3` type: `NUMBER`
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` is defined with the following properties:
		- key: `AAPL,ig-platform-id` value: `0600260A` type: `DATA`
		- key: `device-id` value: `12040000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con1-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con1-pipe` valuue: `12000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con2-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con2-pipe` value: `12000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-cursormem` value: `00009000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-patch-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`

- Note that it's better NOT to use the `CsmVideoDxe.efi` to enable higher resolutions if/when using external monitors and tp  keep Clover boot resolution at 1024x768.

**KEXT RELATED:**
- Using **[Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/lilu/releases)** and **[WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases)** to enable Intel HD4600 _(with FakeID injection and device properties defined in Clover as outlined above)_
- Using  **[VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/virtualsmc/releases)**  _(instead of  [FakeSMC](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-fakesmc-kozlek/downloads/)  and  [ACPIBatteryManager.kext](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-acpi-battery-driver/downloads/))_ to enable battery status
	- Include all VirtualSMC kexts except for `SMCDellSensors.kext`
	- Patch DSDT with Rehabaman's `Asus G75VW`  battery patch
- Using **[AsusSMC](https://github.com/hieplpvip/AsusSMC)** with `[als] Fake ALS` and `[kbd] Haswell` and `F3 to F6` patches without AsusSMCDaemon to enable Asus Function Keys and Keyboard Backlight _(instead of  [AsusNBFnKeys.kext](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/1968-fn-hotkey-and-als-sensor-driver-for-asus-notebooks/))_
- Using acidanthera's [VoodooPS2.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2) instead of emlydinesh's [ApplePS2SmartTouchPad.kext](https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/1948-elan-focaltech-and-synaptics-smart-touchpad-driver-mac-os-x) which supports AsusSMC and F9 key to disable trackpad
- Using acidanthera's [AirportBrcmFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup) to enable wireless but need to set `brcmfx-driver=2` boot argument to enable, as well as removing `AirPortBrcm4360_Injector.kext` from plugins folder within kext to support Big Sur.
- Using acidanthera's [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) to enable bluetooth
	-  `BrcmPatchRAM3.kext`, `BrcmFirmwareData.kext`, and `BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext` 
- Using custom **[USBMap.kext](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap)** to properly enable USB ports/hubs,  instead of FakePCIID.kexts *(which will cause slow startup and wifi issues in Big Sur)*
	- Note this enables camera, and is also needed to enable wireless and sdcard support
- Using cholonam's [Sinetek-rtsx.kext](https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx/releases) to enable SD card reader *([original version](https://github.com/sinetek/Sinetek-rtsx) is causing kernel panic in Big Sur when mounting SD card)*
- Using Mieze's  [RealtekRTL8111.kext](https://github.com/Mieze/RTL8111_driver_for_OS_X/releases) to enable LAN
- Using modified version of Rehabman's [CodecCommander.kext](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-eapd-codec-commander/downloads/) for `ALC668` to resolve [audio issue](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/alc1150-dual-boot-with-windows-and-10-10-3-no-sound-solved.162380/) when dual-booting with Windows.
- Using acidanthera's [NVMeFix](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix) to improve support for NVMe drive and enable TRIM *(optional)*

**DSDT RELATED:**

 - [This guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/)  by RehabMan is still *one of the best* by far when it comes to disassembling and modifying the DSDT.

 - All `Common Patches` from the RehabMan guide have been applied to the DSDT, including the `Fix PNOT/PPNT` patch, as I am <ins>not</ins> including OEM SSDT *(only ssdtPRGen SSDT)* and also apply  `Add IMEI` patch as DSDT does **not** contain HECI/IMEI device.
 - Applied `USB3_PRW 0x0D (instant wake)` patch to fix USB causing wake after sleep.
 - Applied `[bat] Asus G75VW` patch for battery status support.
 - Applied [patches to disable Nvidia Optimus](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/295584-disabling-nvidia-optimus-card-on-all-laptops/) and improve battery life.

**OpenCore Related:**

 - Note that I experienced issues with restart failing while using OpenCore and for that reason chose to stick with Clover for now, but OpenCore is pretty much the standard bootloader now when it comes to macOS.
 - Follow [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) specific to Haswell Laptops  to get started. 
 - Note that (like with Clover), I had to set the bootloader resolution to 1024x768 in OpenCore or display output was garbled;  To do this edit `UEFI -> Output -> Resolution` in the OpenCore `config.plist` and set it to 1024x768.
 - There were also issues with `AppleALC` causing the system to fail on boot when `alcid` boot arg was present (or having DeviceProperties set for audio);  I believe this is due to needing the GFX0 -> IGPU and B0D3 -> HDAU patches in place  (I quickly tested using a patched DSDT and this fixed it; Still need to test with OpenCore hotpatch instead).
 - Getting Battery Status and AsusSMC/Keyboard Backlight requires DSDT edits, since I couldn't find any SSDT-based equivlents for this, however using a DSDT with OpenCore is not recommended, since it applies the ACPI to _all operating systems_ in a multiboot setup, so be careful when going this route.
 - If migrating from Clover, ensure you've upgraded to Big Sur via the suggested `Preboot` method above, or OpenCore will fail to detect the macOS partition.
