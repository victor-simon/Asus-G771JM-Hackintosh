## Preface
It's been a very long time since I've done a *fresh install* on this unit, as I hackintoshed it with when first getting this unit 6 or 7 years ago with **Mavericks**, and have only done upgrades since then, so this is more for my own notes than an actual installation guide.

## Hardware Specs
- Intel Core i7-4710HQ [Haswell] Processor 2.5 GHz (Turbo up to 3.5 GHz)
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M (4GB GDDR5, GM107) Optimus w/Intel HD4600
- Mediatek MT7630E (Ralink) WiFi -> Replaced with [BCM94352HMB](https://www.newegg.ca/broadcom-bcm94352hmb-m-2-mini-pci-e/p/0XM-00BD-00005)
- Realktek HD Audio ALC668
- Realtek RTS5208 PCI Card Reader
- Asus SmartTouch (Synaptics) PS2 Touchpad

## Quick Installation Notes

 - Use one of the [guides](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-create-a-macos-big-sur-public-beta-installation-usb.300100/) available on the internet to create USB installer for Big Sur and complete installation. 
 - Note that I preferred to use **Clover** *(v5123 or greater)*, because I am using the internal NVMe drive/controller for my OSX installation with the latest OEM BIOS which does NOT support booting from the NVMe controller and requires use of the **NvmExpressDxe.efi** driver with Clover installed to an EFI on one of the internal SATA drives.
 - OpenCore wasn't detecting the macOS system partition for whatever reason using this method but Clover was so I just chose to stick with it.
 - You can [build a custom BIOS](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?110850-G771JM-Custom-BIOS-with-NVMe-Support) to enable support for booting directly from the NVMe controller/drive instead, but I was getting random BSOD in Windows and reverted back to this more stable method.
 - You need to enable some DSDT patches in Clover to support Catalina or greater, specifically the `EC0 to EC` patch *(see more detailed installation notes below)* but essentially can use the same `config.plist` for Clover on your installation USB if installed for the same `Asus G771JM` model.

## Detailed Installation and Configuration Notes
**BIOS RELATED:**

Ensure BIOS has Display Memory set to 64MB and that both Secure Boot and CSM mode is disabled.   If VT-d left enabled, ensure to enable `DsiableIoMapper` quirk in Clover.

**CLOVER RELATED:**

 - **ACPI/DSDT/Patches**  include: `change _OSI to XOSI`, `change _DSM to XDSM`, `change EC0 to EC`, `change GFX0 to IGPU`, `change SAT0 to SATA`, `change EHC1 to EH01`, `change EHC2 to EH02`, and `change B0D3 to HDAU`
 
  - **ACPI/SSDT/Generate/PluginType** is enabled (true) to take advantage of CPU scaling SSDT generated by **[ssdtPRGen](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh)**.

 - SMBIOS Definition set for **MacBookPro11,2** which closely matches the hardware of the Asus G771JM

 - Enable the following Quicks in Clover v5123 or greater to enable proper OpenRuntime.efi support:
	 - AvoidRuntimeDefrag
	 - EnableSafeModeSlide
	 - EnableWriteUnprotector
	 - ProvideCustomSlide
	 - SetupVitrualMap
	 - DsiableIoMapper *(if VT-d enabled in BIOS)* 
	 - XhciPortLimit

- `Devices` has  `IntelGFX` set to `0x04128086`, `Audio` -> `Inject`set to 3, `SetIntelBacklight` and `SetIntelMaxBacklight` enabled.
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1B,0x0)` is defined with the following properties: 
		- key: `No-hda-gfx` value: `00000000 00000000 00` type: `DATA`
		-  key: `alc-layout-id` value: `3` type: `NUMBER`
	- `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` is defined with the following properties:
		- key: `AAPL,ig-platform-id` value: `0600260A` type: `DATA`
		- key: `device-id` value: `12040000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con1-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con1-pipe` valuue: `12000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con2-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-con2-pipe` value: `12000000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-cursormem` value: `00009000` type: `DATA`
		- key: `framebuffer-patch-enable` value: `01000000` type: `DATA`

- Note that it's better NOT to use the `CsmVideoDxe.efi` to enable higher resolutions if/when using external monitors and tp  keep Clover boot resolution at 1024x768.

**KEXT RELATED:**
- Using  **[VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/virtualsmc/releases)**  _(instead of  [FakeSMC](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-fakesmc-kozlek/downloads/)  and  [ACPIBatteryManager.kext](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-acpi-battery-driver/downloads/))_
	- Include all VirtualSMC kexts except for `SMCDellSensors.kext`
